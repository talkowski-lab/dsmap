### Data access

Most data not already hosted by a public resource (e.g., UCSC Genome Browser, ENCODE Data Hub) has been stored in a Google Bucket (`gs://dsmap/`).  

Note that GCP permissions will be required to access the contents of this bucket. For permissions to access this bucket, please [email Ryan Collins](mailto:rlcollins@g.harvard.edu)
